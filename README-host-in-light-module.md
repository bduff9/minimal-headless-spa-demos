# Deploy your SPA - IN A LIGHT MODULE

(This README is for the special case of deploying a SPA in a light module. For most purposes hosting a SPA on it's own server is a best practice, and provides a better development experience. This is described in the main [README](README.md) file.)

(This method of deployment ***in this demo project*** is not actively maintained.)

Build and deploy the SPA to make it available for editing.

### Remix

Go to `/spa/remix-minimal` on the terminal and run `npm install`.

See the `.env.example` files for important configurations.

Start Magnolia up with `mgnl start`.

Start the Remix app locally by running `npm run dev`.
